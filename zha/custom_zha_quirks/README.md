The files contained within `custom_zha_quirks` are the files that you would place in your `/config/custom_zha_quirks` directory.

+ [`e1e_g7f.py`](https://github.com/iamjoshk/home-assistant-collection/blob/main/zha/custom_zha_quirks/e1e_g7f.py): this is a quirk that I modified for my own use, forked from the original [`zha-device-handlers`](https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers) repo.
